## Projects

### 1. **Grade Calculator**
- Calculates weighted grades for exams and projects.
- Implements input validation to ensure valid grades.
- Demonstrates arithmetic operations, control flow, and user interaction.

### 2. **Patterns**
- Prints text-based geometric patterns using loops and nested loops.
- Demonstrates iteration, logic, and formatted console output.

### 3. **Bitwise Operations**
- Performs byte swapping, masking, and bit counting.
- Highlights bit-level manipulation and low-level C++ operations.

### 4. **C-Strings and Array Algorithms**
- Implements functions for C-style strings: length, compare, assign.
- Implements algorithms such as insertion sort, duplicate removal, and edit distance.
- Demonstrates pointer array manipulation, dynamic memory management, and recursion.
